# Priority Encoder Parity Checker Module for Tiny Tapeout

The Priority Encoder with Parity Checker is a Verilog module written for [Tiny Tapeout SKY25a shuttle](https://app.tinytapeout.com/shuttles/ttsky25a) that does [priority encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_encoder) of a 9-bit binary input into a 4-bit binary code. On the [Tiny Tapeout demo board](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-demo-pcb) the decimal equivalent (1 to 9) of the priority code will be output on the 7-segment display. Additionally it also does parity checking and outputs the resultant parity bit.
